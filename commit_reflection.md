# Reflection
### Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
- I think that so far I can because my commits have been fairly simple so far. Once my website starts to have a much larger number of edits, and they become more complicated, I think that my commits should be labeled more specifically and also with a more detailed description if needed. 

### How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
- I think my commits effectively communicate that i made several updates, they aren't specific, but my edits weren't anything complex. 

### How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
- I like to make shortfilms, so I spent a lot of time on Premiere Pro editing. It often gets very confusing when I make edits and then forget later on what they were because I can't see my editing history. This is so frustrating. Having this feature would be so useful on that software, especially if I can go back to a specific edit from my history and start again if I disliked where my project was going.
