The most challenging part of creating my drawing of the snowman was lining everything up the way it should be so that everything was in the right spot. Initially I just eyeballed where I thought things should go, but eventually I got used to the relationships between each shape where they all needed to be placed. Playing with the different commands such as stroke and fill was a bit difficult too before I learned the right way to use them because I continously kept filling my entire drawing with one color or taking the lines off all of my shapes before learning that I had to write Stroke or fill again to reinstate the command. 
Additionally, the grid makes so much more sense to me now and where to place each shape, except the lines and the triangle still confuse me a little bit. But I will get the hang of those shapes eventually. 
I am proud of my snowman because it is exactly how I wanted it to turn out, possibly better because I kept playing with it after I finished what my initial planning drawing had.
